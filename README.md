# Sentimeet - _Meeting emotions analyzed in real time!_
## Project Proposal
- Sentimeet is a chrome extension that provides real-time meeting analytics and assists individuals with emotional impairments during virtual meetings. It analyzes facial expressions and speech to detect emotions, providing participants with insights into meeting dynamics, participant engagement, and sentiment trends. The extension offers an interactive user interface that displays meeting analytics, helping users understand and enhance their communication and collaboration.
- The primary target users of Sentimeet are professionals participating in virtual meetings and individuals with autism. Professionals benefit from meeting analytics, enabling them to identify engagement levels, optimize meeting productivity, and make data-driven decisions. Individuals with autism gain support in understanding emotional cues during meetings, fostering better social interactions and enhancing their communication skills.
- We were inspired to create Sentimeet after recognizing the need for more inclusive and efficient virtual meetings. The idea emerged from our interest in utilizing computer vision and natural language processing to empower individuals with autism in their professional lives. Through Sentimeet, we aim to leverage cutting-edge technologies to improve meeting experiences for diverse audiences, making them more productive, engaging, and inclusive.

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
